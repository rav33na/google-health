# Rain or Shine with Google 

This project was part of a Hackathon held at BrainStation that was hosted by Google. We were put into interdisciplinary teams (Web Developement, Digital Marketing, UX Design and Data Science) and given a problem space to tackle within 24 hours. 

# Problem Space 
The problem space in this case was "How might we create meaningful solutions to improve our communitiesâ€™ access to health care services."

My talented group got to work brainstorming and came up with an app that would scan pill bottles, enlarge and read out the labels to assist those who may have issues with their vision making it hard to read the small font on the labels. Our solution was thought of with the elderly generation in mind. 1 in 4 Canadians
are considered senior citizens and 26.3% of Canadians will become disabled between ages 65 to 74. With these statistics in mind, and the idea of advancements in technology helping to make health care more accessible, we solidified our idea and got to work. 

# Technology Used 

My fellow Web Developer/teammate Janet and I, immediately remembered hearing about Google's Cloud API's just earlier that week. We were able to implement two different Google APIs to create functionality. 

Cloud Vision API uses Optical Character Recognition to translate image to text, we utilized this to read the text off the lables of the pill bottles. 

Next, we needed to read the text outloud. We implemented Google's Cloud Text-to-Speech API which translate text into an MP4 file that can be played back to the user.
